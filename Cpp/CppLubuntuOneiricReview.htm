  History: From <a href="CppMac.htm">Mac</a> and <a href="CppWindows.htm">Windows</a> to <img src="PicUbuntu.png" alt="Ubuntu"/>
</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="CppUbuntu.htm">Ubuntu</a> was my first step into <a href="CppLinux.htm">Linux</a> from both 
<a href="CppMac.htm">Mac</a> and <a href="CppWindows.htm">Windows</a>. 
My first <a href="CppUbuntu.htm">Ubuntu</a> distribution was Karmic Koala. I liked the user-friendly 
graphical user interface of <a href="CppUbuntu.htm">Ubuntu</a> and its quick access to the command line.
I was happy to set the GUI to 'quick' instead of 'beautiful'. As a programmer I especially enjoy the package management
from the Ubuntu Software Center and Synaptic and apt-get.</p>

  History: from Ubuntu Maverick Meerkat to Lubuntu Natty Narwhal</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In May 2011 the <a href="CppUbuntu.htm">Ubuntu</a> version Natty Narwhal was released, with a new graphical user
interface called Unity. I tried to master Unity for a month: as the Desktop wallpaper I put a keyboard shortcut reference guide.
Yet after a month, I could not access my programs as fast as I would like to and I decided to look for other *buntu distributions.
I discovered <a href="CppLubuntu.htm">Lubuntu</a> Natty Narwhal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="CppLubuntu.htm">Lubuntu</a> Natty Narwhal had a simple graphical user interface. The response of this GUI was so quick,
I had to re-adept to this speed (similar as making the switch from <a href="CppWindows.htm">Windows</a> XP to 
<a href="CppUbuntu.htm">Ubuntu</a>).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="CppLubuntu.htm">Lubuntu</a> Natty Narwhal had its issues: watching YouTube could possibly freeze the entire system
and a hard boot would be needed to resolve this. Additionally, I failed to connect to a wireless network: it was too difficult
for me. But due to the fast and simple graphical user interface, I accepted these issues.</p>

  From Natty Narwhal to Oneiric Ocelot
</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In October 2011 the <a href="CppLubuntu.htm">Lubuntu</a> version Oneiric Ocelot was released. This release would be
its first release after <a href="CppLubuntu.htm">Lubuntu</a> was accepted as an official *buntu distribution: there
would be a focus on improving the quality of the previous version, instead of adding new features.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In <a href="CppLubuntu.htm">Lubuntu</a> Oneiric Ocelot the problems I had with Natty Natwhal are resolved: 
YouTube does not freeze the system anymore and connecting to a wireless network
had become easy! Except for this, the user interface remained unchanged (except for a different main menu graphic),
so I lost no time finding my way again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="CppLubuntu.htm">Lubuntu</a> Oneiric Ocelot does have some small issues now:</p>
<ul>
  <li>In gedit, the cursor is not always visible</li>
  <li>When pressing SUPER-R to start the Run window, this window is not put into focus</li>
</ul>
<p>The first issue can be solved easily: in the gedit Preferences, select to highlight the
current line and the cursor will always be visible. The second issue is annoying, but I guess it will be easy to fix.</p>

  Conclusion
</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The upgrade from <a href="CppLubuntu.htm">Lubuntu</a> Natty Narwhal to <a href="CppLubuntu.htm">Lubuntu</a>
Oneiric Ocelot brough me big advantages (YouTube and connection to wireless networks), took me no time
to get to know the near-identical graphical user interface, and yielded one new small annoyances.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For me, <a href="CppLubuntu.htm">Lubuntu</a> Oneiric Ocelot was a step forward in a direction I liked.</p>
